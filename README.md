anagram me
A program that finds anagrams of an input list of chars from a dictionary file. This project was implemented using a hash function that maps char values to prime numbers and generated a hash value. If a hash value from the dictionary is divisible by the input list of chars then that dictionary word is an anagram of the input list of chars.
